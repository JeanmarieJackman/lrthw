# Learn Ruby, the Graph Way

A graph-based version of Learn Ruby The Hard Way.

## Why LRTHW?

Effective learning balances progress and struggle. LRTHW uses a cool combination of rote-learning to build confidence, challenges to build understanding, and projects to build application.

Being able to script procedural programs in Ruby (and perhaps other languages, since graph curricula are easily extensible) isn't something you need a coding bootcamp for. Bootcamps should focus on vocational training, creating professional, work-ready software engineers. Coding is a small but necessary part of that: learn it before you go.

## Curriculum Methodology

1. Take [notes](./doc) on each [LRTHW](https://www.amazon.ca/Learn-Ruby-Hard-Way-Computational/dp/032188499X) exercise.
2. Figure out a graph model for it. Add application projects as key nodes and reading/challenges/practicals as extension nodes.
3. Integrate with [Graph](https://github.com/makersacademy/graph).
4. Try it out as part of an open "learn programming" system.
